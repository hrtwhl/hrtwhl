### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Willi, driven by the challenge of understanding how macro shapes markets â€” using data, models, and economic insight. I hold a BSc in Economics from WU Vienna and am currently pursuing my MSc in Economics at the same institution.

Here, I share some projects Iâ€™ve developed in my free time.
