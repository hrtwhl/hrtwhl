👋 Hi, I’m Wilhelm Hartung  
💹 I’m driven by the challenge of understanding how macro shapes markets — using data, models, and economic insight.  
🎓 I hold a BSc in Economics from WU Vienna and am currently pursuing my MSc in Economics at the same institution.  
🧑‍💻 Here, I share some projects I’ve developed in my free time.
